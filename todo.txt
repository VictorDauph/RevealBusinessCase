how to navigate? usestates on the table component that evolve with the buttonclicks.
Redo the fetch with the useState

1)left side:
-All cities (button and fetch) OK
-countries  + (number of cities) (button and fetch) OK
-visual indicator of selected country (background color changed) OK
-We can fetch by countries but not with a determined number of cities(the answer always has 500 cities) OK

2)table:
-citylink:its page to geoname  OK
-columns: Name(+link) - Country - Sub-Country OK
/!\ implement React Window on the table

3)testing:
We need to test one aspect of the code. Maybe the fetching and displaying of a country related cities?
It should be the most complex feature of the app.
- How to use Jest?

Careful:
- Don't render all the cities at the same time. Use some fractionated rendering triggered by user screen position.(React-Window)
- We can fetch all of the cities data at the the same time, but not render all.
- use the country database ton build the side menu.
- Keep the commnentarys and modularity in mind.
- Use typescript and React specificities
